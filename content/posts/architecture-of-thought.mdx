If your note-taking app is cluttered, your thoughts will be cluttered. Design is cognitive architecture.

<Callout type="system">
Environment shapes cognition. Engineer your surroundings, engineer your mind.

<SectionHeading number={1}>The Extended Mind</SectionHeading>

The philosopher Andy Clark proposed that cognition extends beyond the brain into the environment. Your notebook, your workspace, your tools—they are all part of your cognitive system.

This has profound implications for how we design our spaces, both physical and digital. Every element either supports or hinders clear thinking.

<SectionHeading number={2}>Physical Variables</SectionHeading>

The research is clear on environmental factors that enhance cognition:

- **Light**: Natural light increases alertness and creativity
- **Temperature**: Slightly cool (65-68°F) optimizes mental performance
- **Sound**: Ambient noise at ~70dB can enhance creative thinking
- **Plants**: Greenery reduces stress and improves focus

export WORKSPACE="minimal && intentional"
export DISTRACTION_LEVEL=0
source ~/.cognitive_config
</TerminalBlock>

<SectionHeading number={3}>Digital Variables</SectionHeading>

Your digital environment matters just as much:

- **File Organization**: A clear hierarchy reflects clear thinking
- **Tool Selection**: Fewer tools, mastered deeply
- **Visual Design**: Clean interfaces reduce cognitive load
- **Notification Settings**: Silence is the default state

Treat your environment as a system to be optimized. Small changes compound into dramatic improvements in cognitive performance. Your best thinking awaits in your best environment.
