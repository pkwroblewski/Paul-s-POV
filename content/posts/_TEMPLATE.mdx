Your opening paragraph. This is your hook—the first thing readers see. Set up the main theme, ask a compelling question, or make a bold statement. No heading needed here.

<Callout type="system">
Your key insight or thesis statement. The one thing you want readers to remember.
</Callout>

<SectionHeading number={1}>First Main Point</SectionHeading>

Expand on your first idea here. Use paragraphs naturally.

You can add **bold** for emphasis or *italics* for nuance.

<SectionHeading number={2}>Second Main Point</SectionHeading>

Your second major argument or observation.

- Bullet points work great for lists
- Keep them concise
- Three to five items is ideal

<SectionHeading number={3}>Third Main Point</SectionHeading>

Continue with your third section. Add more sections as needed—there's no limit.

1. Numbered lists are good for steps or priorities
2. They imply sequence or ranking
3. Use when order matters

<TerminalBlock>
# Optional: add code or commands if relevant to your topic
echo "Delete this section if you don't need it"
</TerminalBlock>

Your closing paragraph. Tie everything together. Offer a final reflection, a call to action, or leave the reader with a thought-provoking question.
