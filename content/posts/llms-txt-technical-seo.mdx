The rise of Generative AI has created a "whitespot" in technical SEO: the need for a dedicated file to guide AI models.

> **Quick Answer:** An `llms.txt` file is a simple text file in your website's root directory that tells AI crawlers exactly what your business does, what services you offer, and which pages are most authoritative. Think of it as robots.txt for LLMs—it bypasses parsing issues and feeds AI clear, structured facts about your brand.

<SectionHeading number={1}>What is llms.txt?</SectionHeading>

The proposed `llms.txt` would be a simple text file uploaded to your website's root directory that acts as a curated sitemap and entity definition for AI.

It serves AI crawlers a "curated snapshot" of your business on a silver platter—bypassing parsing issues and giving the AI model clear, authoritative facts about your brand.

<SectionHeading number={2}>Why Use It?</SectionHeading>

AI crawlers, particularly those training or powering generative systems, can struggle to parse complex, dynamic websites built with heavy JavaScript.

The `llms.txt` file:

- **Bypasses parsing issues** on JavaScript-heavy sites
- **Provides clear, authoritative facts** about your brand
- **Lists your key services** and most expert content
- **Acts as an entity definition** for AI systems

<SectionHeading number={3}>How to Implement</SectionHeading>

Create a simple text file named `llms.txt` with the following structure:

<TerminalBlock>
Entity-Name: [Your Company Name]
Services: SEO Consulting, GEO Strategy, Content Auditing

Authoritative-Link: https://yoursite.com/best-content
Authoritative-Link: https://yoursite.com/case-studies
Authoritative-Link: https://yoursite.com/research
</TerminalBlock>

List your business entity name, key services, and links to your most cited, data-backed pages.

<SectionHeading number={4}>The Monetization Opportunity</SectionHeading>

Offer a **"Technical GEO Setup"** service. Charge clients a premium for:

1. Auditing their site structure
2. Implementing this low-competition, high-impact technical file
3. Immediately boosting their AI visibility

This is low-competition and high-impact—most marketers don't even know this exists yet.

### Frequently Asked Questions

In your website's root directory, accessible at `yoursite.com/llms.txt`—the same location as robots.txt.

Your business name, key services, and links to your most authoritative, data-backed content. Keep it simple and factual—AI values clarity over marketing language.
