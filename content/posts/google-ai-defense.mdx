Businesses are losing traffic to generative AI and are terrified. A direct B2B service offering positioned as "Defense" taps into a powerful psychological sales trigger.

> **Quick Answer:** Businesses are losing organic traffic to AI Overviews and zero-click answers—and they're terrified. Position your service as "AI Defense": audit whether clients appear in AI answers, then offer ongoing optimization to get them cited. This fear-based positioning justifies premium retainers ($1,000+/month) because you're selling survival, not marketing.

The fear of extinction is your greatest sales tool.

<SectionHeading number={1}>The Pain Point</SectionHeading>

Start your pitch with compelling data: imagine a graph showing a top-ranking website losing 86% of its organic traffic the day a new AI overview launched.

This isn't hypothetical—it's happening right now to businesses across industries.

The fear is real, and it's visceral.

<SectionHeading number={2}>The Service: AI Visibility Audit</SectionHeading>

**Diagnosis Phase:**

Perform a manual or tool-assisted audit. For key business queries, check if the client's brand appears in:

- Google's AI Overview
- ChatGPT's output
- Microsoft Copilot's responses

If they don't appear, you've identified the problem.

<SectionHeading number={3}>The Upsell: The Retainer</SectionHeading>

If they do not appear in AI answers, sell a high-ticket, recurring monthly retainer to:

1. Optimize their brand entity data
2. Build local citations and online reviews
3. Restructure content for AI citation

The explicit goal: get their brand into the AI's answer.

<SectionHeading number={4}>The Monetization Model</SectionHeading>

This B2B service is ideal for **high-ticket monthly retainers** (starting at $1,000+) because the perceived value is *survival*.

You are selling:

- An "insurance policy" against traffic loss
- A competitive edge in the new answer engine
- Peace of mind in an uncertain landscape

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How do I prove a client needs AI Defense?**
Run a manual audit: search their key business queries in ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity. If competitors appear and they don't, you've demonstrated the problem visually.

**What's included in an AI Visibility retainer?**
Entity optimization, structured data implementation, content restructuring for citations, review management, and monthly AI visibility tracking across major platforms.

**Why can I charge $1,000+ for this service?**
Because the perceived value is survival, not optimization. When traffic drops 50%+, businesses will pay premium prices to stop the bleeding.

**Is this just repackaged SEO?**
Partially. But the framing matters. "AI Defense" addresses an existential fear that "SEO services" doesn't. Same tactics, different emotional positioning.

When you frame your service as defense against an existential threat, price becomes secondary. You're not selling marketing—you're selling survival.
