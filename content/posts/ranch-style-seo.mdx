The old SEO tactic of writing one enormous guide is inefficient for AI. The new GEO tactic is to build a "ranch" of smaller, interconnected, highly specific articles.

> **Quick Answer:** The Skyscraper Technique—creating one massive "ultimate guide"—fails in the AI era because LLMs answer specific questions, not broad topics. Instead, build a "content ranch": 10-20 highly specific articles that each become the definitive answer for a niche query. Specificity beats comprehensiveness when AI is selecting sources to cite.

LLMs are designed to give specific answers to specific intents—not to summarize a wall of text.

<SectionHeading number={1}>Why the Skyscraper is Dead</SectionHeading>

The Skyscraper Technique—writing one giant 5,000-word guide on a broad topic—fails in the AI era.

Generative AI is designed to answer specific questions. When faced with a massive, comprehensive guide, the AI often:

- Struggles to extract the relevant portion
- Misses nuanced, specific details
- Defaults to more focused sources

<SectionHeading number={2}>The New Way: Content Ranch</SectionHeading>

Instead of "The Ultimate Guide to Digital Marketing," create a "ranch" of 10-20 highly specific, expert articles:

- "Tax Strategies for UK Crypto Freelancers"
- "Best Budget Email Marketing Tools for E-commerce"
- "Q4 TikTok Ad Strategy Breakdown"

Each article becomes the definitive source for its specific niche query.

<SectionHeading number={3}>Why Specificity Wins</SectionHeading>

AI models reward content with **Information Gain**—unique, fresh data and highly granular perspectives that aren't already widely available.

By becoming the definitive source for niche, long-tail answers, you make it easy for the AI to grab your content and use it as the citation.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**What's wrong with comprehensive guides?**
Nothing—for human readers. But AI extracts specific answers to specific questions. A 5,000-word guide on "Digital Marketing" loses to a focused 800-word article on "TikTok Ad Strategy for E-commerce" when someone asks about TikTok ads.

**How specific should ranch-style articles be?**
Very specific. Target long-tail queries with clear intent. "Best CRM for solo consultants under $50/month" beats "Best CRM Software" for AI citations.

**Should I delete my existing Skyscraper content?**
No—repurpose it. Break your comprehensive guide into 10-15 focused articles, each targeting a specific sub-query. Link them together for internal SEO benefits.

**How many ranch-style articles do I need?**
Quality over quantity. Start with 10-20 highly specific, expert-level articles in your niche. Each should be the definitive answer for its target query.
