AI lets juniors produce senior-level output. That sounds great until you think about what's missing.

<Callout type="system">
AI dramatically compresses the capability gap between junior and senior employees—a graduate with AI tools can now produce analysis that previously required years of experience. But this creates the **experience gap paradox**: juniors may produce senior-level output without developing senior-level judgment. The solution is deliberate learning design.

<SectionHeading number={1}>How AI Is Changing the Junior-Senior Gap</SectionHeading>

In the [previous post](/writing/manager-new-job-orchestra-conductor), I explored how AI agents are transforming managers from taskmasters into orchestra conductors. But there's a deeper challenge emerging—one that keeps thoughtful leaders up at night.

AI dramatically compresses the capability gap between junior and senior employees.

A graduate with the right AI tools can now produce analysis, code, or written content that would have taken years of experience to generate manually. We're seeing the emergence of what I'd call "The 10x Junior"—entry-level workers producing senior-level output with AI assistance.

Sounds like pure upside. Productivity gains across the board.

Not so fast.

<SectionHeading number={2}>What's Lost When AI Does the Grunt Work</SectionHeading>

Those "grunt work" tasks that juniors traditionally slogged through? They weren't just busywork. They were how people developed judgment.

**The junior analyst who manually built financial models for three years** learned to spot errors instinctively.

**The junior developer who debugged legacy code for months** developed an intuition for system architecture.

**The junior consultant who created hundreds of slide decks** learned what actually persuades stakeholders.

When AI handles these tasks, juniors might leap to senior-level output without ever building senior-level judgment.

They become supervisors of AI without understanding the fundamentals of what the AI is doing.

**Here's an analogy:** you'd probably prefer a mathematician who uses a calculator over someone who *only* knows how to push calculator buttons. The mathematician has mental models about what reasonable answers look like. The button-pusher just accepts whatever appears on the screen.

This is the experience gap paradox: AI enables faster output but potentially slower development of the judgment that makes output valuable.

<SectionHeading number={3}>The Digital Doppelganger</SectionHeading>

Here's a related concept that sounds like science fiction but is already happening: the **Digital Doppelganger**.

Consider a pattern I've seen in enterprise AI implementations. A senior engineer approaching retirement carries three decades of institutional knowledge about company systems. Rather than let that expertise walk out the door, the organisation deploys systems to capture how he works—how he diagnoses problems, which questions he asks, what patterns he recognises, how he structures solutions.

**The result?** An AI system trained on his approach. A digital version that can be consulted by junior engineers long after the original expert retires.

This might sound dystopian. But look at it from another angle: that expertise now scales infinitely. Instead of being available to help one team at a time, his pattern recognition and judgment are available to the entire organisation, 24/7.

**Gartner predicts that by 2027, 70% of new employee contracts will include licensing clauses for AI representations of workers' personas.** Your expertise, your communication style, your decision-making patterns—these may become assets that outlive your tenure at any particular company.

The practical implication? Document everything. Explain your reasoning out loud. When you make a judgment call, articulate why.

You're not just doing your job anymore. You're potentially creating training data for your own replacement—or more optimistically, your own force multiplier.

<SectionHeading number={4}>How Managers Can Bridge the Gap</SectionHeading>

This is where the reinvented manager becomes essential.

**The manager's new primary duty is bridging the experience gap.** They must design deliberate opportunities for humans to practice judgment—even when AI could handle the task faster.

What does this look like practically?

- **Require manual attempts before AI assistance.** Not for everything, but for foundational skills. The junior who wrestles with a problem first will better evaluate whether the AI's solution makes sense.

- **Create scenarios with intentionally flawed AI outputs.** Train people to catch errors, not just accept outputs. This builds the skepticism muscles that prevent costly mistakes.

- **Build review processes that probe reasoning, not just outputs.** Asking "is this answer correct?" is less valuable than asking "why do you believe this answer is correct?"

- **Structure learning paths that ensure fundamentals aren't skipped.** The speed-to-competence gains from AI shouldn't come at the cost of understanding.

**The manager who can develop AI-literate workers who still possess deep expertise will be worth their weight in gold.** The manager who lets their team become passive AI operators will lead a team of button-pushers—vulnerable to any shift in the technology.

The pattern here: AI compresses timelines but doesn't automatically transfer wisdom. Someone has to bridge that gap deliberately.
