This addresses a critical "Whitespot": measuring something that didn't exist two years ago—your visibility within generative AI outputs.

> **Quick Answer:** To measure AI visibility, manually query ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity with your key business questions and track how often your brand is mentioned vs. competitors. Key metrics: Citation Frequency (how often you're cited), AI Mention Rate (% of relevant queries where you appear), and Share of Voice (your mentions vs. competitors). Traditional SEO tools don't track this yet.

Traditional SEO tools are still playing catch-up. Marketers know Google Analytics, but few know how to check Share of Voice in an AI.

<SectionHeading number={1}>The Challenge</SectionHeading>

Traditional SEO tools like SEMrush and Ahrefs are still adapting to the rapid evolution of generative results.

We need new metrics and new methods.

<SectionHeading number={2}>Manual Prompt Auditing (SpyGPT)</SectionHeading>

Use the major AI models to manually audit your visibility:

**Competitor Audit:**

<TerminalBlock>
Prompt: "Who are the top competitors for [Your Niche]?"
Prompt: "What are the best [Your Product] alternatives?"
Prompt: "Who is the leading expert in [Your Field]?"
</TerminalBlock>

**Track Citation Frequency:**

Count how often your brand and your competitors are mentioned in the generative answer—not just in the links below.

Start tracking these KPIs:

1. **Citation Frequency**: The number of times your brand/content is cited in generative answers
2. **AI Mention Rate (AMR)**: The percentage of relevant queries where your brand is mentioned by an AI
3. **Share of Voice**: Your mentions vs. competitor mentions in AI outputs

This is ideal for **Affiliate Revenue**:

- Partner with emerging GEO tracking tools building AI visibility dashboards
- Sell custom **AI Visibility Audit Reports** to clients
- Create recurring revenue through monthly tracking services

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Are there tools that track AI visibility automatically?**
Emerging tools are being built, but the space is early. For now, manual auditing ("SpyGPT") is the most reliable method. Check major AI platforms monthly with your key queries.

**How often should I audit AI visibility?**
Monthly for key queries. AI models update their knowledge bases regularly, so your visibility can change. Track trends over time, not just snapshots.

**What queries should I test?**
Focus on high-intent queries your customers ask: "Best [product] for [use case]", "How to [solve problem]", "[Your brand] vs [competitor]". Test 10-20 core queries consistently.

**Can I improve visibility in one AI but not others?**
Yes. Each AI model has different training data and retrieval methods. You might appear in Perplexity but not ChatGPT. Optimize for all major platforms.
