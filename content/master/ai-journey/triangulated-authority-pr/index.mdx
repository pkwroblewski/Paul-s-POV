To be trusted by AI, you must be mentioned on other authoritative sites. AI validates facts by cross-referencing multiple sources—a process known as triangulation.

> **Quick Answer:** AI trusts sources that are mentioned consistently across multiple authoritative sites—a principle called triangulation. A single backlink helps SEO, but a network of brand mentions (even unlinked) helps GEO. Shift from link-building to mention-building: get your brand cited in industry reports, "best of" lists, and expert roundups across the web.

<SectionHeading number={1}>The Mechanism of Trust</SectionHeading>

AI models don't just look for facts on your site—they look for consistent reinforcement of those facts across a "web" of credible mentions:

- News outlets
- Industry blogs
- LinkedIn profiles
- Academic papers

When multiple authoritative sources say the same thing about you, AI trusts it as fact.

<SectionHeading number={2}>Strategic Digital PR</SectionHeading>

Shift your PR efforts from **link-building** (for SEO) to **mention-building** (for GEO).

Aim to get your brand, data, and experts cited in:

- "Best of" lists and roundups
- Editorial articles and industry reports
- Expert quotes in news coverage

<SectionHeading number={3}>The Data</SectionHeading>

Research by tools like Ahrefs has already shown that brand mentions—even unlinked ones—correlate most strongly with visibility in Google's AI Overviews.

The link itself matters less than the mention.

<SectionHeading number={4}>The Wikipedia Effect</SectionHeading>

Your ultimate goal: become the definitive, small-scale Wikipedia of your specific niche.

A source that is cited so frequently and consistently across the web that AI considers you the default authority.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Do unlinked mentions really help with AI visibility?**
Yes. Research shows brand mentions correlate strongly with visibility in AI Overviews—the link itself matters less than the mention. AI validates facts by seeing them repeated across multiple sources.

**How many mentions do I need for triangulated authority?**
There's no magic number, but aim for consistent mentions across 5-10 authoritative sources in your niche. Quality matters more than quantity.

**What's the difference between PR for SEO vs PR for GEO?**
SEO PR focuses on getting links. GEO PR focuses on getting mentioned—in quotes, expert roundups, industry reports, and editorial coverage. The link is a bonus, not the goal.

**How do I get mentioned without paying for PR?**
Become a quotable source: publish original research, offer expert commentary on trends, and respond to journalist queries on platforms like HARO or Quoted.
