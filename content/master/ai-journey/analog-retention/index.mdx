The friction of the pen on paper is a feature, not a bug.

Motor cortex engagement during handwriting creates stronger memory traces.

<SectionHeading number={1}>The Science of Handwriting</SectionHeading>

Studies consistently show that handwritten notes lead to better retention than typed notes. The reasons are neurological:

- **Motor Engagement**: Writing activates more brain regions than typing
- **Forced Synthesis**: Slower speed requires summarization, not transcription
- **Spatial Memory**: Physical placement on a page creates memory anchors

Digital tools offer convenience: searchability, backup, sync. But they extract a cost in cognitive processing.

When I type, I capture. When I write, I think.

# Memory retention comparison
echo "Handwritten notes: 70% retention after 1 week"
echo "Typed notes: 35% retention after 1 week"
echo "No notes: 10% retention after 1 week"
</TerminalBlock>

<SectionHeading number={3}>Hybrid Approaches</SectionHeading>

The answer isn't to abandon digital tools. It's to use each medium for its strengths:

- **Capture**: Digital for speed and searchability
- **Synthesis**: Paper for deep processing and retention
- **Archive**: Digital for long-term storage and retrieval
- **Creativity**: Paper for ideation and brainstorming

My personal system: I take notes by hand during the day, then spend 15 minutes each evening digitizing the key insights. This double-processing significantly enhances retention.

Don't let the allure of high-tech solutions blind you to the power of low-tech wisdom. Sometimes the old ways persist because they work.
