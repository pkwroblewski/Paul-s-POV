The speed of information has outpaced the speed of understanding.

Not everything that can be consumed immediately should be.

<SectionHeading number={1}>The Tyranny of Real-Time</SectionHeading>

We've built a world where information flows continuously—24/7 news cycles, live updates, instant notifications. But human cognition wasn't designed for this constant stream.

The result is shallow processing. We skim, we scroll, we forget. Nothing has time to sink in, to be processed, to become wisdom.

<SectionHeading number={2}>The Case for Delay</SectionHeading>

What if we intentionally introduced delay into our information diet?

- **Daily Digests** instead of constant updates
- **Weekly Reviews** instead of real-time feeds
- **Monthly Deep Dives** instead of surface skimming

The Slow Web movement advocates for a return to asynchronous consumption. Read the article tomorrow; it will still be relevant. Watch the video next week; its value won't have diminished.

cron: 0 7 * * 1 /usr/bin/consume_weekly_digest
# Once per week is enough
</TerminalBlock>

<SectionHeading number={3}>Building Slow Systems</SectionHeading>

This isn't about being behind—it's about being thoughtful. Some principles:

1. **Batch Inputs**: Aggregate sources into periodic digests
2. **Increase Latency**: Add friction to impulse consumption
3. **Prioritize Depth**: Choose long-form over short-form
4. **Accept Missing Out**: JOMO over FOMO

The Slow Web isn't anti-technology. It's pro-humanity. It's a recognition that our minds need time to process, to synthesize, to understand. Speed is not always the answer.
