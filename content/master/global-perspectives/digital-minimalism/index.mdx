Attention is the currency of the modern economy, and inflation is rampant. We are over-connected and under-focused.

In the age of infinite distraction, the ability to focus is a superpower.

<SectionHeading number={1}>The Attention Economy</SectionHeading>

Every app on your phone is designed by teams of engineers whose sole purpose is to capture and monetize your attention. This is not hyperbole—it's the business model.

The result? We've become scattered, anxious, and perpetually distracted. Our minds are fragmented across dozens of tabs, notifications, and feeds.

<SectionHeading number={2}>Systems Architecture for Focus</SectionHeading>

Reclaiming your attention requires systems thinking. Just as we architect software systems for resilience and performance, we must architect our digital lives for focus and depth.

The principles:

1. **Default to Offline**: Make connectivity the exception, not the rule
2. **Batch Communication**: Process inputs at scheduled intervals, not on-demand
3. **Ruthless Curation**: Fewer sources, deeper engagement
4. **Physical Boundaries**: Create spaces free from digital intrusion

<SectionHeading number={3}>The Deep Work Protocol</SectionHeading>

I've developed a personal protocol for deep work that has transformed my productivity:

- **Morning Block** (4 hours): No connectivity, no meetings, pure creation
- **Communication Window** (2 hours): Batch all emails, messages, and calls
- **Afternoon Block** (3 hours): Secondary creative work, research, reading
- **Evening Reset**: Physical activity, no screens after sunset

The results speak for themselves: my output has tripled while my stress has halved.

Digital minimalism isn't about rejecting technology. It's about using it intentionally, as a tool rather than a master. The goal is not less technology—it's more humanity.
