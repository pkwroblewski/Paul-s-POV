Examining the biological impact of inverted interfaces.

<Callout type="system">
The preference for dark mode may be more than aesthetic—it may be cognitive.

<SectionHeading number={1}>The Rise of Dark Interfaces</SectionHeading>

Dark mode has swept across operating systems, applications, and websites. What began as a developer preference has become a mainstream expectation.

But is it actually better for us, or is it simply... cooler?

<SectionHeading number={2}>The Evidence</SectionHeading>

Research on the cognitive effects of dark mode is mixed but intriguing:

**Potential Benefits:**
- Reduced eye strain in low-light conditions
- Lower power consumption on OLED screens
- Less blue light emission at night
- Decreased visual distraction (less "glowing screen" effect)

**Potential Drawbacks:**
- Reduced readability for long-form text
- Harder to perceive details in images
- May increase astigmatism symptoms for some users

$ cat /proc/visual_cortex/mode
DARK_MODE: enabled
FOCUS_BOOST: +12%
EYE_STRAIN: -28%

<SectionHeading number={3}>Context Matters</SectionHeading>

The answer isn't universal—it depends on context:

- **Night Work**: Dark mode reduces circadian disruption
- **Day Reading**: Light mode may offer better readability
- **Code Editing**: Dark backgrounds reduce contrast fatigue
- **Design Work**: Neutral gray backgrounds preserve color perception

My recommendation: use system-level automatic switching based on time of day. Let your interface adapt to your environment.

Dark mode isn't just a trend—it's a recognition that our interfaces should adapt to us, not the other way around. The best interface is the one you don't notice.
